    "## Introduction: Why Wasserstein?\n",
    "\n",
    "[cite_start]*Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated impressive results in unsupervised learning, yet they are notoriously difficult to train*[cite: 34]. [cite_start]*Standard GAN training is \"delicate and unstable,\" often requiring a precise balance between the discriminator and generator to prevent vanishing gradients or mode collapse*[cite: 34, 53].\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper ***\"Wasserstein GAN\"*** (Arjovsky et al., 2017) argues that these issues stem from the choice of distance metric used to measure the gap between the real data distribution ($\\mathbb{P}_r$) and the model distribution ($\\mathbb{P}_\\theta$). [cite_start]*Traditional approaches, which often optimize proxies for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) or Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences, fail when these distributions are supported by low-dimensional manifolds that do not overlap* [cite: 14-17]. [cite_start]*In these disjoint cases, the gradient often vanishes or becomes undefined, halting learning*[cite: 17, 198].\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Earth-Mover Distance\n",
    "The authors propose using the ***Earth-Mover (EM) distance*** (also known as Wasserstein-1). [cite_start]*Intuitively, if we view probability distributions as piles of earth, the EM distance is the minimum cost to transport the mass from one pile to match the other* [cite: 73-74].\n",
    "\n",
    "[cite_start]*Unlike JS or KL divergences, the EM distance is continuous and differentiable almost everywhere, even when distributions are disjoint* [cite: 81, 112-114]. [cite_start]*This provides smooth, usable gradients for the generator throughout the training process*[cite: 124, 201].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions Annotated in this Project\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement the ***WGAN*** algorithm to demonstrate its two primary claims:\n",
    "1.  [cite_start]***A Meaningful Loss Metric:*** *We show that the WGAN critic's loss correlates with sample quality, allowing for easier debugging and hyperparameter search* [cite: 54-55, 235].\n",
    "2.  [cite_start]***Improved Stability:*** *We demonstrate that WGANs are robust to architectural choices and do not require the delicate balancing of generator and discriminator capacities typical of standard GANs*[cite: 52, 342]."

    "In a classical GAN, the generator tries to make the discriminator classify fake samples as real. In WGAN, the generator has a different role. It simply tries to reduce the critic score of its fake samples. Since the critic score approximates the Wasserstein distance, minimizing this value pushes the generated distribution closer to the real one in terms of optimal transport. There is no adversarial classification involved, only the minimization of an estimated distance.\n",

    "### 2.5 Synthesis: How the Parts Come Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The full WGAN pipeline combines the generator, critic, loss functions, and training loop into a single system that approximates and minimizes the Earth Mover distance between the real distribution \\(P_r\\) and the model distribution \\(P_\\theta\\). The diagram below summarizes the flow of information through the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Synthesis_diagram](Synthesis_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unified Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generator produces fake samples**  \n",
    "   Noise vectors \\( z \\sim p(z) \\) are transformed by the generator into fake data \\( g_\\theta(z) \\).  \n",
    "   These samples represent the model distribution \\(P_\\theta\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critic processes both real and fake data**  \n",
    "   The critic \\( f_w \\) outputs real valued scores for:\n",
    "   * real data \\( f_w(x) \\)\n",
    "   * fake data \\( f_w(g_\\theta(z)) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since the critic has no sigmoid, its output is a scalar that can freely increase or decrease to approximate the optimal Kantorovich potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critic estimates the Wasserstein distance**  \n",
    "   The critic maximizes the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim P_r}[f_w(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}[f_w(g_\\theta(z))].\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is exactly the dual form of the Earth Mover distance from equation (2) in the paper:\n",

    "   W(P_r, P_\\theta) = \n",
    "   \\sup_{f \\,\\text{is 1-Lipschitz}} \n",
    "   \\left( \n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim P_r}[f(x)] \n",
    "   - \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim P_\\theta}[f(x)]\n",
    "   \\right).\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Weight clipping ensures \\( f_w \\) remains in a K Lipschitz function class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Critic is updated multiple times**  \n",
    "   To approximate the supremum in the dual formulation, the critic is trained for `ncritic` steps before each generator update.  \n",
    "   This allows it to closely estimate the Wasserstein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generator is updated once per cycle**  \n",
    "   After the critic is near optimal for its current parameters, the generator performs one update to minimize\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   L_{\\text{gen}} = -\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}[f_w(g_\\theta(z))].\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Reducing this value means reducing the critic’s estimate of the EM distance, which pushes the generated distribution toward the real one.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Gradients flow through the critic into the generator**  \n",
    "   Although the critic is not trained during the generator update, its gradients provide the direction in which the generator must move to decrease the Wasserstein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Pipeline Implements Optimal Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire system forms a neural approximation of the optimal transport problem. The critic attempts to solve the dual formulation of the Earth Mover distance by learning a 1-Lipschitz function that best separates real and fake data. The generator then moves samples in the direction that reduces this separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the training loop alternates:\n",
    "* the critic estimates \\( W(P_r, P_\\theta) \\),\n",
    "* the generator minimizes that estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an end to end procedure in which gradient based optimization performs stochastic descent on the Wasserstein distance itself. The result is a stable learning process with meaningful, smooth gradients that do not vanish even when the real and model distributions initially lie on disjoint low dimensional manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
